    <p style="font-size: 18px; padding: 100px;">This page will allow users to input lineups and players from dropdown lists. The first dropdowns to appear will be to select a team, and from the team, the user can select the players. There will also be a slider for the user to adjust the number of simulations. There will also be a button that says “Run Simulation” and the simulation has run, the dropdowns and slider will disappear, and the user will be presented with the simulation summary. Key information will be bolded for easy identifying. Underneath the summary, there will be a button for “Run New Simulation” which will remove the summary and represent the user with the dropdowns and slider. It will utilize a step-by-step workflow.</p>
